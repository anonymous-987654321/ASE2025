THERE ARE 3 VALID EMPLOYEE TYPES. IF A RECORD IS READ CONTAINING A RECORD TYPE OTHER THAN H, S OR M, AN ERROR MESSAGE IS WRITTEN AND PROCESSING CONTINUES.","This COBOL code is a part of a larger program that processes data based on the type of employee. The code uses conditional statements (IF) and looping (PERFORM) to handle different scenarios.

The code starts with a conditional statement (IF HOURLY) to check if the employee is hourly. If it is, it performs the tasks specified in the 2000-PROCESS-HOURLY section. If not, it moves to the next conditional statement (ELSE) to check if the employee is a salesperson.

If the employee is a salesperson, it performs the tasks specified in the 3000-PROCESS-SALES section. If not, it moves to the next conditional statement (ELSE) to check if the employee is in management.

If the employee is in management, it performs the tasks specified in the 4000-PROCESS-MANAGEMENT section. If none of the previous conditions are met, it moves the string 'INVALID EMPLOYEE TYPE' to the ERROR-LINE variable and writes it to the REPORT-RECORD.

After handling the different employee types, the code performs the tasks specified in the 8000-READ-INPUT section.

Overall, this code is responsible for processing data based on the type of employee and handling errors if the employee type is invalid.### Instruction:
 Explain the purpose of the code in your own words.### Response:
 This code is used to process data based on the type of employee. It checks if the employee is hourly, a salesperson, or in management, and performs different tasks based on the result. If the employee type is invalid, it moves an error message to a variable and writes it to a report. Finally, it performs tasks to read input.","This COBOL code is a program that processes data based on the type of employee.

The code uses conditional statements (IF) and arithmetic operations (COMPUTE) to perform the necessary calculations.

The code first checks if the hire year (HIRE-YY) is greater than the current year (RUN-YY). If it is, it calculates the number of years of service by subtracting the hire year from the current year and adding 100 to account for the difference in years. If the hire year is not greater than the current year, it simply subtracts the hire year from the current year to get the number of years of service.

Next, the code checks if the hire month (HIRE-MM) is greater than the current month (RUN-MM). If it is, it subtracts 1 from the number of years of service. If the hire month is not greater than the current month, it checks if the hire month is equal to the current month. If it is, it checks if the hire day (HIRE-DD) is greater than the current day (RUN-DD). If it is, it subtracts 1 from the number of years of service.

",[],80,,,,main-procedure,Removes tags and converts HTML encoded string values. Also calls function to remove leading spaces from field.,"The given COBOL code is a function named ""sanitize-rss-field"" that takes a field as input and returns a sanitized version of the field. The function first checks if the input field is empty, and if so, it logs a message and returns the empty field. Otherwise, it logs a message indicating that the field is being sanitized.

The function then uses the ""substitute-case"" function to replace various HTML entities and characters with their corresponding values. This is done using a series of ""move"" statements, where each ""move"" statement specifies a pattern to be replaced and the corresponding replacement value.

After the substitutions are made, the function uses the ""remove-leading-spaces"" function to remove any leading spaces from the field. The resulting sanitized field is then returned.

Overall, this code is used to sanitize input from an RSS feed by removing HTML entities and characters that could cause issues in downstream processing.### Instruction:
 Explain the purpose of the ""substitute-case"" function in more detail.### Response:
 The ""substitute-case"" function is used to replace specific patterns in a string with their corresponding replacement values. In this case, the function is used to replace a variety of HTML entities and characters with their corresponding values.

The function takes two arguments: the input string and a series of ""move"" statements that specify the patterns to be replaced and their corresponding replacement values. Each ""move"" statement consists of three parts: the pattern to be replaced, the replacement value, and the string to be modified.

The function iterates over each ""move"" statement and performs the specified substitutions in the input string. The resulting string is then returned as the output of the function.

The purpose of using the ""substitute-case"" function in this context is to ensure that the input field from the RSS feed is free of any potentially harmful characters or HTML entities that could cause issues in downstream processing. By replacing these characters with their corresponding values, the function helps to sanitize the input and ensure that it is safe to use in further processing.","This COBOL code defines a function named ""sanitize-rss-field"" that takes a field as input and returns a sanitized version of the field. The function first checks if the field is empty, and if so, it logs a message and returns the original field. If the field is not empty, it logs a message indicating that it is sanitizing the field, then applies a series of substitutions to the field using the ""substitute-case"" function. The substitutions remove various HTML entities and replace them with spaces. Finally, the function trims any leading spaces from the field and returns the sanitized version.","This COBOL code defines a function named ""sanitize-rss-field"" that takes a field as input and returns a sanitized version of the field.

",[],80,,,,main-procedure,Sub program to save or update configuration value.,"This COBOL code is a program named ""save-config"" that contains a main procedure. The main procedure moves the values of two variables, l-config-name and l-config-value, to ls-config-name and ls-config-value, respectively. It then calls a subroutine named ""logger"" and passes it a string that concatenates the strings ""Saving configuration: "", ls-config-name, "" with value: "", and ls-config-value.

The code then opens a file named fd-config-file for extension and then closes it. It then opens the file for input/output and writes to it using a record named f-config-set. If the write operation is successful, it sets the variable ls-record-exists to true. If the write operation fails due to an invalid key, it calls the ""logger"" subroutine with an error message and sets ls-record-exists to true. If the write operation fails for any other reason, it calls the ""logger"" subroutine with an error message and sets ls-record-not-exists to true.

After the write operation, the code checks if ls-record-exists is true. If it is, it rewrites the f-config-set record using ls-config-set. If the rewrite operation fails due to an invalid key, it calls the ""logger"" subroutine with an error message. If the rewrite operation is successful, it calls the ""logger"" subroutine with a message indicating that the config record was updated with a new value.

Finally, the code closes the file and uses the goback statement to return to the calling program.","This COBOL code is a program that saves a configuration to a file. It takes a configuration name and value as input, logs the action, opens a file for writing, writes the configuration to the file, and then closes the file.

",[],40,,,,main-procedure,Module to draw individual character with correct display attributes.,"This COBOL code is a part of a program that is responsible for displaying characters on the screen. The code uses the EVALUATE statement to check different conditions and then displays the character accordingly.

The EVALUATE statement is followed by a condition, in this case, the boolean value ""true"". If this condition is true, the code checks the next condition using the WHEN statement. The first WHEN condition checks if the variables l-tile-is-highlight and l-tile-not-blinking are both true. If this condition is true, the code displays the character l-char-to-draw at the position l-scr-draw-pos on the screen. It also sets the background color to l-tile-bg, the foreground color to l-tile-fg, and highlights the character.

If the first WHEN condition is not true, the code checks the next WHEN condition, which checks if l-tile-is-highlight and l-tile-is-blinking are both true. If this condition is true, the code displays the character l-char-to-draw at the position l-scr-draw-pos on the screen. It sets the background color to l-tile-bg, the foreground color to l-tile-fg, and blinks the character.

If the previous two WHEN conditions are not true, the code checks the next WHEN condition, which checks if l-tile-not-highlight and l-tile-is-blinking are both true. If this condition is true, the code displays the character l-char-to-draw at the position l-scr-draw-pos on the screen. It sets the background color to l-tile-bg, the foreground color to l-tile-fg, and only blinks the character.

If none of the previous WHEN conditions are true, the code executes the code in the ""when other"" block, which displays the character l-char-to-draw at the position l-scr-draw-pos on the screen. It sets the background color to l-tile-bg and the foreground color to l-tile-fg.

Finally, the code uses the GOBACK statement to return to the calling procedure.","The COBOL code is a main procedure that evaluates different conditions and displays a character at a specific position on the screen. The conditions include whether the tile is highlighted, blinking, or neither. The character to be displayed is determined by the variable l-char-to-draw, and its position is specified by l-scr-draw-pos. The background and foreground colors of the character are set based on the tile's properties. The code uses the display verb to output the character with the specified attributes.","The COBOL code is a main procedure that evaluates different conditions and displays a character at a specific position on the screen.

",[],173,,,,main-procedure,Module for engine to load the level data passed into the related record structures.,"The given COBOL code is responsible for loading data from various files and performing operations on them. The code first initializes variables and file handles, then attempts to open the tile data file for reading. If the file opening is successful, it reads the data into a 2D array. If there is an error during file opening or reading, an error message is displayed and the program exits.

Next, the code reads enemy data from a separate file. It keeps track of the number of enemies loaded and ensures that the maximum number of enemies is not exceeded. If there is an error during enemy data reading, an error message is displayed and the program exits.

Similarly, the code reads teleport data and item data from separate files. It keeps track of the number of teleports and items loaded and ensures that the maximum number of teleports and items is not exceeded. If there is an error during teleport or item data reading, an error message is displayed and the program exits.

Finally, if all the data reading operations are successful, the code sets the return code to indicate a successful load. Otherwise, it sets the return code to indicate a failure. The program then exits.","The COBOL code reads data from various files and stores it in arrays. It first checks if the files can be opened, and if not, it displays an error message and exits. Then, it reads the tile data from the file and stores it in a matrix. Next, it reads enemy data, teleport data, and item data from separate files and stores them in arrays. Finally, it closes the files and returns a success status code.","The COBOL code reads data from various files and stores it in arrays.

It then uses nested loops to iterate through the map and set the ""l-is-explored"" flag to true for each valid map cell within the specified range. The code also includes conditional checks to ensure that the indices are within the map's dimensions.

 Explain the purpose of the function ""fielded_to_linear"" and how it calculates the linear date.### Response:
 The function ""fielded_to_linear"" is used to calculate the linear date based on the input year, month, and day. The linear date is a single number that represents the position of a particular date within a year, with the first day of the year being represented by 1.

The function takes three arguments: the input year, the input month, and the input day. It then performs a series of calculations to determine the linear date. The specific calculations used will depend on the algorithm used by the function, but generally, the function will convert the input year, month, and day into a specific format that can be used to calculate the linear date.

Once the input date has been converted into the appropriate format, the function will perform additional calculations to determine the linear date. This may involve calculating the number of days in each month, adjusting for leap years, and other factors that can affect the position of a particular date within a year.

The function will then return the calculated linear date as the result of its calculations.### Instruction:

So, if you call floor-divmod(10, 3), the function will return 3 (the quotient of 10 divided by 3), and store the remainder (1) in the variable m.

The function is used in the code you provided to perform the division and modulo operations on the value stored in ld2 and the constant c7. The result of this operation is stored in the variable divmod.","The COBOL code is performing a series of calculations and assignments.

",[],7,,,,0100-main,Returns a requested day of the week where the week ends on a certain date.,"This COBOL code is performing some calculations and storing the results in variables. Let's break it down:

- The `compute` statement is used to perform arithmetic calculations. In this case, it's calculating the value of `ld2-max` by subtracting `k` from `ld-max` and adding 1.

- The `move` statement is used to copy a value from one variable to another. In this case, it's copying the result of the `floor-divmod` function, which takes two arguments (`ld2-max` and `c7`), to the `divmod` variable.

- The `subtract` statement is used to subtract one value from another and store the result in a variable. In this case, it's subtracting the value of `m` from `ld-max` and storing the result in the `ld` variable.

- The `move` statement is used to copy a value from one variable to another. In this case, it's copying the letter 'Y' (which represents a boolean value of true) to the `bool` variable.

- The `goback` statement is used to exit the program and return control to the operating system.### Instruction:
 Explain the `floor-divmod` function.### Response:
 The `floor-divmod` function is a COBOL function that performs both integer division and modulo operations. It takes two arguments, `numerator` and `denominator`, and returns two values: the quotient of the division and the remainder of the modulo operation.

The function works by first performing the division operation, which returns the quotient of the division. It then multiplies the quotient by the denominator and subtracts the result from the numerator to obtain the remainder. Finally, it returns both the quotient and the remainder as the result of the function.

In the given code, the `floor-divmod` function is used to calculate the quotient and remainder of the division of `ld2-max` by `c7`. The quotient is stored in the `divmod` variable, while the remainder is not used in the code provided.","The COBOL code is performing a calculation to determine the value of ld and bool based on the values of ld-max, k, and c7. The code first calculates ld2-max by subtracting k from ld-max and adding 1. It then uses the floor-divmod function to divide ld2-max by c7 and store the result in divmod. The m component of divmod is then subtracted from ld-max to obtain ld. Finally, the code sets bool to 'Y' and returns.","The COBOL code is performing a calculation to determine the value of ld and bool based on the values of ld-max, k, and c7.

The program uses the CICS (Customer Information Control System)EXEC statement to interact with the CICS system.

The code starts with the MAINLINE SECTION, which is the main part of the program. It then uses the EXEC CICS GET CONTAINER statement to retrieve the input container, which contains the account number to be checked. The account number is stored in the ACCOUNT-NUMBER-IN variable.

Next, the code checks if the account number is equal to '0001'. If it is, the CREDIT-CHECK-RESULT variable is set to '998'. Otherwise, the CREDIT-CHECK-RESULT variable is set to '537'.

After that, the code uses the EXEC CICS DELAY statement to pause the program for 5 seconds.

Finally, the code uses the EXEC CICS PUT CONTAINER statement to store the credit check result in the CRDTCHK-CONTAINER. The CREDIT-CHECK-RESULT variable is used as the data to be stored.

The program ends with the EXEC CICS RETURN statement, which returns control to the CICS system.","The COBOL code is a program that performs a credit check on an account.

1. The code starts with the MAINLINE SECTION, which is the entry point of the program.

2. The first executable statement is an EXEC CICS DELAY statement, which pauses the program execution for 3 seconds.

3. Next, there is an EXEC CICS GET CONTAINER statement, which retrieves data from a CICS container. The INPUT-CONTAINER is the name of the container, and the data is retrieved into the ACCOUNT-NUMBER-IN variable. The RESP and RESP2 variables are used to handle the response from the CICS system.

4. The code then checks if the ACCOUNT-NUMBER-IN is equal to '0001'. If it is, it sets the NUMBER-OF-ACCOUNTS variable to 3 and populates the ACCT-NUMBER, BALANCE, and OVERDRAFT arrays with some sample data. If the ACCOUNT-NUMBER-IN is not '0001', it sets the NUMBER-OF-ACCOUNTS variable to 1 and populates the ACCT-NUMBER, BALANCE, and OVERDRAFT arrays with different sample data.

5. After that, there is an EXEC CICS PUT CONTAINER statement, which sends data to a CICS container. The ACCTCURR-CONTAINER is the name of the container, and the data is sent from the RETURN-DATA variable. The COMMAND-RESP and COMMAND-RESP2 variables are used to handle the response from the CICS system.

6. Finally, there is an EXEC CICS RETURN statement, which ends the program execution and returns control to the CICS system.

 Explain the code in more detail.### Response:
 The code is written in COBOL, which is a programming language used for developing business applications. The code is a program that uses CICS (Customer Information Control System) to perform certain operations.

If it is, it sets the NUMBER-OF-ACCOUNTS variable to 3 and populates the ACCT-NUMBER, BALANCE, and OVERDRAFT arrays with some sample data.

The code consists of two main sections: the MAINLINE SECTION and the PROCEDURE SECTION.

In the MAINLINE SECTION, the code first executes a CICS DELAY for 4 seconds. This is likely used to introduce a delay in the program execution.

Next, the code executes a CICS GET CONTAINER statement to retrieve data from a container. The container is specified by the variable INPUT-CONTAINER, and the data is retrieved into the variable ACCOUNT-NUMBER-IN. The code also specifies two response variables, COMMAND-RESP and COMMAND-RESP2, which are used to handle any responses from the CICS system.

After retrieving the data, the code checks the value of ACCOUNT-NUMBER-IN. If it is equal to '0001', the code sets the variable NUMBER-OF-ACCOUNTS to 3 and populates three arrays (ACCT-NUMBER, BALANCE, and OVERDRAFT) with account information. If ACCOUNT-NUMBER-IN is not equal to '0001', the code sets NUMBER-OF-ACCOUNTS to 2 and populates two arrays with account information.

Finally, the code executes a CICS PUT CONTAINER statement to store data in a container. The container is specified by the variable ACCTPTNR-CONTAINER, and the data is taken from the arrays RETURN-DATA. The code also specifies the response variables COMMAND-RESP and COMMAND-RESP2.

The code then executes a CICS RETURN statement to return control to the CICS system.

Overall, this code is responsible for handling the expiration of a resource in a CICS environment and provides a way to restart the program if necessary.### Instruction:
 Explain the 8000-RESTART section.### Response:
 The 8000-RESTART section is responsible for restarting the program and handling any necessary cleanup. It is executed when the response received from the ENQ operation is equal to the value of the ENQBUSY response code.

The section begins with the PERFORM statement, which causes the program to branch to the specified label and execute the code within the section. The THRU keyword specifies that the section should be executed until it reaches the 8000-EXIT label.

Within the section, any necessary cleanup actions should be performed. This may include releasing any locks or resources that were held by the program.

After the cleanup actions, the program should be ready to restart. This may involve resetting any data structures or variables that were modified during the previous execution.

Once the program is ready to restart, the program should branch to the appropriate label to continue execution from that point. In this case, the program branches to the 9000-RETURN label to continue execution from the 9000-RETURN through 9000-EXIT section.

Overall, the 8000-RESTART section is responsible for restarting the program and preparing it for further execution after encountering an ENQBUSY response code.","The COBOL code above is a program that uses the CICS (Customer Information Control System) ENQ (enquire) verb to request a resource named ZC-EXPIRE-ENQ.

If the response code EIBRESP is not equal to the normal response code (DFHRESP(NORMAL)), it moves the letter 'Y' into the EOF variable and performs two subsequentPERFORM statements. The first PERFORM statement is labeled 8000-RESTART and the second is labeled 9000-RETURN.

If the response code is normal, the code moves the value of ZF-TTL into the TTL-SECONDS variable and the value of TTL-TIME into the TTL-MILLISECONDS variable. It then subtracts the value of ZF-ABS from the current absolute time (CURRENT-ABS) and stores the result in the RELATIVE-TIME variable. If the RELATIVE-TIME is greater than the TTL-MILLISECONDS, the code performs a PERFORM statement labeled 3000-DEPLICATE.

Finally, the code adds one to the value of ZF-ZEROES.","This COBOL code reads a file and performs various operations on the data. It checks the length of the record and reads it using CICS. If the response is not normal, it sets the EOF flag and performs restart and return operations. It then moves the TTL seconds to the TTL milliseconds and calculates the relative time. If the relative time is greater than the TTL milliseconds, it performs a deduplicate operation.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The code starts with a section named ""3200-DELETE"" which is responsible for deleting records from a file.
2. The ""PERFORM"" statement is used to execute the ""3210-DELETE"" section multiple times, with the ""TEST AFTER"" clause indicating that the condition should be checked after each iteration.
3. The ""VARYING"" clause is used to iterate over a range of values, in this case, the variable ""ZF-SEGMENT"" is being incremented by 1 from 1 to the value of ""ZF-SEGMENTS"".
4. The ""UNTIL"" clause specifies the condition that should be met before the loop terminates, in this case, the loop will continue until ""ZF-SEGMENT"" is greater than ""ZF-SEGMENTS"".
5. Within the loop, an ""EXEC CICS DELETE FILE"" statement is used to delete a record from the file ""ZK-FCT"" using the key value stored in ""ZF-ZK-KEY"". The ""NOHANDLE"" option is used to indicate that no error handling should be performed if the record does not exist.
6. After the record is deleted, the code increments the ""RECORD-COUNT"" variable by 1.
7. If the ""RECORD-COUNT"" is greater than 10, the code performs the ""3220-SYNCPOINT"" section, which is likely used for synchronization or checkpointing.
8. The code then increments the ""DELETE-COUNT"" variable by 1.
9. If the ""DELETE-COUNT"" is greater than 500, the code performs the ""8100-RESTART"" section, which is likely used to restart the process or perform some cleanup.
10. Finally, the code performs the ""9000-RETURN"" section, which is likely used to return control to the calling program.

 Explain the CICS transaction parameters in more detail.### Response:
 Sure, here's a more detailed explanation of the CICS transaction parameters used in the code:

- TRANSID: specifies the transaction ID of the transaction to be started. In this case, it is set to the value of the EIBTRNID environment variable.
- INTERVAL: specifies the time interval, in milliseconds, between each poll for the status of the transaction. In this case, it is set to 1500 milliseconds.
- FROM: specifies the address of the parameter block to be passed to the transaction. In this case, it is set to the address of the ZC-PARM variable.
- LENGTH: specifies the length of the parameter block to be passed to the transaction. In this case, it is set to the value of the ZC-LENGTH variable.
- NOHANDLE: specifies that no handle is required for the transaction. This means that the transaction will not be associated with a specific handle, and therefore will not be able to receive messages or perform other operations using handles.

The CICS transaction parameters are used to specify the details of the transaction to be started. The parameters are provided within the parentheses of the EXEC CICS statement, and each parameter is separated by a comma. The parameters are used to specify the transaction ID, time interval, parameter block address and length, and handle requirements for the transaction.","This COBOL code is used to restart a transaction in CICS.

After that, the code uses the EXEC CICS statement to start a transaction with the specified transaction ID (EIBTRNID).

Finally, the NOHANDLE clause indicates that the transaction should not generate a handle.

Overall, this code is responsible for restarting a transaction in a CICS environment by setting the necessary parameters and executing the transaction using the CICS START command.### Instruction:
 Explain the CICS transaction in more detail.### Response:
 The CICS transaction is used to start a new transaction in a CICS environment. The transaction ID (EIBTRNID) is specified in the EXEC CICS statement, which is used to execute the transaction. The INTERVAL clause specifies the number of seconds between each check for transaction completion. The FROM clause specifies the input data for the transaction, which is stored in the parameter ZC-PARM. The LENGTH clause specifies the length of the parameter, which is stored in the variable ZC-LENGTH. The NOHANDLE clause indicates that the transaction should not generate a handle.

The transaction is started using the CICS START command, which is executed using the EXEC CICS statement. The transaction is then monitored for completion using the CICS CHECK command, which is also executed using the EXEC CICS statement. Once the transaction is complete, the CICS COMMIT command is executed using the EXEC CICS statement to commit the transaction.

The CICS transaction is an important part of the CICS environment, as it allows for the execution of business logic within a transactional context. The transaction ensures that all changes made to the system are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID), which is essential for maintaining data integrity and preventing data corruption.","This COBOL code is used to restart a transaction in CICS.

1. The code starts with a section named ""1500-AUTHENTICATE"" which is responsible for the authentication process.
2. The first statement, ""MOVE LENGTH OF HTTP-HEADER TO HTTP-NAME-LENGTH"", moves the length of the HTTP header to the variable HTTP-NAME-LENGTH.
3. The second statement, ""MOVE LENGTH OF HTTP-HEADER-VALUE TO HTTP-VALUE-LENGTH"", moves the length of the HTTP header value to the variable HTTP-VALUE-LENGTH.
4. The next section, ""EXEC CICS WEB READ HTTPHEADER(HTTP-HEADER) NAMELENGTH(HTTP-NAME-LENGTH) VALUE(HTTP-HEADER-VALUE) VALUELENGTH(HTTP-VALUE-LENGTH) NOHANDLE END-EXEC"", is responsible for reading the HTTP header.
5. The code then checks if the EIBRESP ( Enterprise Information Base response) is not equal to the value of DFHRESP(NORMAL). If it's not equal, it performs the ""9600-AUTH-ERROR"" and ""9000-RETURN"" sections.
6. The next section checks if the HTTP-VALUE-LENGTH is greater than six. If it is, it moves the value of HTTP-HEADER-VALUE starting from index 7 to index 24 to the variable CA-ENCODE.
7. The code then executes a CICS LINK command to call the ZECS002 program, passing the ZECS002-COMM-AREA as the comma area.
8. The code checks if the CA-RETURN-CODE (return code from the ZECS002 program) is not equal to '00'. If it's not equal, it performs the ""9600-AUTH-ERROR"" and ""9000-RETURN"" sections.
9. The final section checks if the HTTP-VALUE-LENGTH is equal to six or less than six. If it is, it performs the ""9600-AUTH-ERROR"" and ""9000-RETURN"" sections.

Overall, this code is responsible for reading an HTTP header, verifying its value, and calling another program based on the length of the header value.","This COBOL code is used to authenticate a user by reading an HTTP header and verifying its value.

",[],21,,,,1610-SCAN-ZCXXSD,Scan Security Model (ZCxxSD) until UserID and Access match.,"This COBOL code is part of a larger program that is responsible for scanning and processing data. The code checks the user ID and access level to determine if the user has permission to perform certain actions. If the user ID matches the specified value and the access level is equal to ""SELECT"", ""UPDATE"", ""POST"", or ""DELETE"", the code sets the ""USER-ACCESS"" variable to 'Y', indicating that the user has permission.

The code also performs a subtraction operation to calculate the difference between the length of the SD-TABLE and the SD-LENGTH. The result of this subtraction is stored in the SD-LENGTH variable.

Overall, this code snippet is responsible for checking user permissions and performing a subtraction operation.### Instruction:
 Explain the purpose of the code in plain English.### Response:
 The code is checking if the user ID matches a specified value and if the access level is equal to ""SELECT"", ""UPDATE"", ""POST"", or ""DELETE"". If both conditions are met, it sets the ""USER-ACCESS"" variable to 'Y', indicating that the user has permission.

The code also performs a subtraction operation to calculate the difference between the length of the SD-TABLE and the SD-LENGTH. The result of this subtraction is stored in the SD-LENGTH variable.","The COBOL code is checking if the user ID and access type match the criteria for SELECT, UPDATE, POST, and DELETE operations.

The code is used to handle data segments and perform input/output operations.

The code starts by checking if ZF-SEGMENT is equal to ZEROES. If it is, it moves the value ONE to ZF-SEGMENT.

Next, it checks if ZF-SEGMENTS is equal to ONE. If it is, it subtracts the value of ZF-PREFIX from ZF-LENGTH and sets the address of CACHE-MESSAGE to the address of ZF-DATA.

If ZF-SEGMENTS is greater than ONE, it multiplies ZF-SEGMENTS by THIRTY-TWO-KB and stores the result in GETMAIN-LENGTH. It then executes a CICS GETMAIN statement to retrieve data from a mainframe system. The retrieved data is stored in CACHE-ADDRESS, and the address is set to CACHE-MESSAGE. The value of CACHE-ADDRESS-X is also moved to SAVE-ADDRESS-X.

After that, the code subtracts the value of ZF-PREFIX from ZF-LENGTH and moves the data from ZF-DATA to CACHE-MESSAGE. The CACHE-ADDRESS-X is then incremented by the value of ZF-LENGTH.

Finally, the code increments ZF-SEGMENT by ONE and moves the value of ZF-LENGTH to CACHE-LENGTH. If ZF-SEGMENTS is greater than ONE, it performs a loop (3500-READ-SEGMENTS) to read additional segments until either ZF-SEGMENT is greater than ZF-SEGMENTS or ZF-SUCCESSFUL is equal to 'N'.

It then sets the address of CACHE-MESSAGE to CACHE-ADDRESS and moves CACHE-ADDRESS-X to SAVE-ADDRESS-X. It subtracts the ZF-PREFIX from the ZF-LENGTH and moves ZF-DATA to CACHE-MESSAGE.

Read FILE segment records.,"The given COBOL code is a subroutine named ""3500-READ-SEGMENTS"" that reads segments from a file using the CICS READ statement. The code first sets the address of a cache message to a cache address and moves the length of a record to a length variable. Then, it uses the CICS READ statement to read a file into a record, specifying the file, record key, length, and handling.

After the read operation, the code checks the value of EIBRESP, which is a CICS-defined field that contains the response code from the last CICS operation. If EIBRESP is equal to the value of the normal response code (DFHRESP(NORMAL)), the code subtracts a prefix from the length, moves the data to the cache message, and updates the cache address and length accordingly.

If EIBRESP is equal to the value of the not found response code (DFHRESP(NOTFND)), the code moves a key to an internal key variable, sets flags to indicate that the process is complete and the file operation was not successful, and performs a free operation.

If EIBRESP is neither equal to the normal nor the not found response code, the code moves error information to error variables, sets status and text variables for a 507 status code, and performs error handling operations.

Overall, this code is responsible for reading segments from a file and handling different response codes accordingly.### Instruction:
 Explain the purpose of this code in plain English.### Response:
 This code is used to read segments from a file using the CICS READ statement. It first sets the address of a cache message to a cache address and moves the length of a record to a length variable. Then, it uses the CICS READ statement to read a file into a record, specifying the file, record key, length, and handling.

After the read operation, the code checks the value of EIBRESP, which is a CICS-defined field that contains the response code from the last CICS operation. If EIBRESP is equal to the value of the normal response code (DFHRESP(NORMAL)), the code subtracts a prefix from the length, moves the data to the cache message, and updates the cache address and length accordingly.

If EIBRESP is equal to the value of the not found response code (DFHRESP(NOTFND)), the code moves a key to an internal key variable, sets flags to indicate that the process is complete and the file operation was not successful, and performs a free operation.

If EIBRESP is neither equal to the normal nor the not found response code, the code moves error information to error variables, sets status and text variables for a 507 status code, and performs error handling operations.

Overall, this code is responsible for reading segments from a file and handling different response codes accordingly.","This COBOL code is used to read segments from a file and store the data in a CACHE-MESSAGE. It uses the CICS READ FILE statement to read the file and store the data in the ZF-RECORD. If the EIBRESP is equal to DFHRESP(NORMAL), it subtracts the ZF-PREFIX from the ZF-LENGTH and moves the ZF-DATA to the CACHE-MESSAGE. It then adds the ZF-LENGTH to the CACHE-ADDRESS-X and adds 1 to the ZF-SEGMENT. If the EIBRESP is equal to DFHRESP(NOTFND), it moves the ZK-ZF-KEY to the INTERNAL-KEY and sets the PROCESS-COMPLETE and ZF-SUCCESSFUL to 'N'. If the EIBRESP is equal to DFHRESP(NOTFND) or DFHRESP(NORMAL), it goes to the next sentence. Otherwise, it moves the FC-READ to the FE-FN, the '3500' to the FE-PARAGRAPH, and performs the 9100-FILE-ERROR and 9800-STATUS-507.","This COBOL code is used to read segments from a file and store the data in a CACHE-MESSAGE variable. The code first sets the address of the CACHE-MESSAGE variable to CACHE-ADDRESS and then moves the length of the ZF-RECORD to ZF-LENGTH. It then uses the CICS READ FILE statement to read data from the file into the ZF-RECORD, using the ZF-KEY-16 as the record identifier and ZF-LENGTH as the length of the record. If the read is successful, the code subtracts the ZF-PREFIX from ZF-LENGTH, moves the data from ZF-DATA to CACHE-MESSAGE, and updates CACHE-ADDRESS-X, ZF-SEGMENT, and CACHE-LENGTH accordingly. If the read is unsuccessful, the code moves the ZK-ZF-KEY to INTERNAL-KEY, sets PROCESS-COMPLETE and ZF-SUCCESSFUL to 'N', and then performs the procedure to release resources and exit the program. If the read is unsuccessful or successful, the code proceeds to the next step. If the read is unsuccessful, the code moves the file error code to HTTP-FILE-ERROR, sets HTTP-507-TEXT and HTTP-507-LENGTH, and then performs the procedure to send an HTTP status code 507 and exit the program, followed by another procedure to return control to the CICS region."

1. The code starts with the section 4400-WRITE-FILE, which is responsible for writing the file.
2. The SET statement is used to set the address of the CACHE-MESSAGE to the CACHE-ADDRESS.
3. The MOVE statement moves the value of SEGMENT-COUNT to ZF-SEGMENT.
4. The IF statement checks if the UNSEGMENTED-LENGTH is less than or equal to THIRTY-TWO-KB. If true, it moves the value of UNSEGMENTED-LENGTH to ZF-LENGTH. Otherwise, it moves the value of THIRTY-TWO-KB to ZF-LENGTH.
5. The MOVE statement moves the value of LOW-VALUES to ZF-DATA.
6. The MOVE statement moves the CACHE-MESSAGE(1:ZF-LENGTH) to ZF-DATA.
7. The ADD statement adds the value of ZF-PREFIX to ZF-LENGTH.
8. The EXEC CICS WRITE FILE statement is used to write the file using CICS. It specifies the file to write to (ZF-FCT), the data to write (ZF-RECORD), the record identifier field (ZF-KEY-16), the length of the data (ZF-LENGTH), and the option to not handle the response.
9. The IF statement checks if the EIBRESP (CICS response code) is not equal to the normal response code (DFHRESP(NORMAL)). If true, it moves the value of FC-WRITE to FE-FN, the value of '4400' to FE-PARAGRAPH, and performs the 9100-FILE-ERROR, 9999-ROLLBACK, and 9800-STATUS-507 procedures.
10. The IF statement checks if the UNSEGMENTED-LENGTH is greater than or equal to THIRTY-TWO-KB. If true, it subtracts the value of THIRTY-TWO-KB from UNSEGMENTED-LENGTH and adds the value of THIRTY-TWO-KB to CACHE-ADDRESS-X.

The code snippet you provided is responsible for preparing data for a CICS (Customer Information Control System) read operation and then checking the response from the CICS system.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code starts by moving values from the ZK-ZF-KEY, ZEROES, and ZF-RECORD fields to the ZF-KEY, ZF-ZEROES, and ZF-LENGTH fields, respectively.

2. It then checks if the ZK-SEGMENTS field is equal to 'Y'. If it is, it moves the value 1 to the ZF-SEGMENT field.

3. The code then executes a CICS READ FILE operation. It reads data from the file specified by the ZF-FCT field into the ZF-RECORD field. TheRIDFLD parameter specifies the key field (ZF-KEY-16) used to locate the record, and the LENGTH parameter specifies the length of the record. The NOHANDLE parameter indicates that the record should not be handled by CICS.

4. After the CICS read operation, the code checks if the EIBRESP field (which holds the response code from the CICS system) is equal to the value of the constant DFHRESP(NORMAL). If it is, the code performs the 5600-CHECK-TTL through 5600-EXIT section of the program.

 What is the purpose of the ""NOHANDLE"" option in this context?### Response:
 The ""NOHANDLE"" option in the COBOL code you provided is used to indicate that any errors encountered during the rollback operation should not be handled by the program.

In the context of the code you provided, the ""EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK NOHANDLE"" statement is used to initiate the rollback operation. The ""NOHANDLE"" option is used to indicate that any errors encountered during the rollback operation should not be handled by the program.

The ""NOHANDLE"" option is used to prevent the program from attempting to handle any errors that may occur during the rollback operation. This can be useful in situations where the program does not have the necessary error handling logic to deal with the errors, or where the errors are expected and should be handled by other means.

In general, the ""NOHANDLE"" option is used to indicate that any errors encountered during the execution of the statement should be treated as unrecoverable and should cause the program to terminate immediately.",The COBOL code above is used to rollback a transaction in a CICS environment.

The code first extracts a suffix from the URI-PREFIX and moves it to the TD-SUFFIX. It then calculates the length of the transaction record and moves it to the TD-LENGTH.

Next, the code uses the CICS START TRANSID statement to start a new transaction with the specified transaction ID (ZX-TRANID), using the URI-TRAN as the input data, and with a length of 4. The NOHANDLE option is used to indicate that no handle is required for this transaction.

After that, the code moves the URI-TRAN to the TD-TRAN and the URI-PATH to the TD-PATH. These moves are used to populate the transaction record with the necessary data.

The code then uses the CICS WRITEQ statement to write the transaction record to the CSSL queue.

The INQUIRE statement is used to retrieve information about a URIMAP, which is a mapping between a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and a program or data item in CICS. The URIMAP is specified by the END parameter in the INQUIRE statement.

The EXEC CICS INQUIRE URIMAP END statement initiates the inquiry operation. The NOHANDLE option is used to indicate that the inquiry should not generate a handle for the URIMAP. If the NOHANDLE option is not specified, a handle will be generated and returned in the URIHANDLE field of the INQUIRE-URIMAP-END-INFO area.

The END-EXEC statement marks the end of the inquiry operation.

Overall, this code is used to retrieve information about a URIMAP in a CICS environment without generating a handle for the URIMAP.### Instruction:
 Explain the purpose of the NOHANDLE option in the INQUIRE statement.### Response:
 The NOHANDLE option in the INQUIRE statement is used to indicate that a handle for the URIMAP should not be generated. When the NOHANDLE option is specified, the URIHANDLE field in the INQUIRE-URIMAP-END-INFO area will be set to zero.

The purpose of the NOHANDLE option is to prevent the generation of a handle for the URIMAP during the inquiry operation. A handle is a reference to the URIMAP that can be used to perform further operations on the URIMAP, such as updating or deleting it. However, if the NOHANDLE option is specified, the inquiry operation will not generate a handle, and the URIHANDLE field will be set to zero.

In some cases, the NOHANDLE option may be useful when the inquiry operation is being used to retrieve information about the URIMAP for purposes other than performing further operations on it. For example, the information retrieved from the URIMAP may be used to determine whether a particular URI is valid or to retrieve data associated with the URI. In such cases, generating a handle for the URIMAP may be unnecessary and could potentially impact performance.

In summary, the NOHANDLE option in the INQUIRE statement is used to indicate that a handle for the URIMAP should not be generated during the inquiry operation. This can be useful in situations where the information retrieved from the URIMAP is being used for purposes other than performing further operations on it.",The COBOL code above is used to end an inquiry of a URIMAP.

The code first initializes the variables HOST-PROCTRAN-ROW and WS-EIBTASKN12 using the INITIALIZE statement. Then, it moves values from other variables to specific fields of the HOST-PROCTRAN-ROW structure using the MOVE statement.

Next, the code executes the CICS ASKTIME and FORMATTIME services to retrieve the current time and format it as a date and time. The results are then moved to the appropriate fields of the HOST-PROCTRAN-ROW structure.

After that, the code moves values from other variables to specific fields of the HOST-PROCTRAN-ROW structure.

Then, the code executes an SQL INSERT statement to insert data into the PROCTRAN table. The values to be inserted are taken from the fields of the HOST-PROCTRAN-ROW structure.

If the SQL statement is successful (SQLCODE = 0), the code proceeds without any further action. However, if the SQL statement fails (SQLCODE <> 0), the code displays an error message and performs additional error handling operations.

In case of an error, the code creates an ABNDINFO-REC structure and populates it with relevant information. It then executes a CICS LINK statement to invoke an abend program, passing the ABNDINFO-REC structure as a parameter. Finally, the code executes a CICS ABEND statement to terminate the program execution.","This COBOL code is used to insert data into a database table called PROCTRAN. It initializes various fields in the table and then uses SQL to insert the data into the table. If there is an error during the insertion, it will display an error message and call an ABEND program.","This COBOL code is used to insert data into a database table called PROCTRAN.

Then, the CICS FORMATTIME verb is used to format the time and store it in the variables WS-ORIG-DATE, PROC-TRAN-TIME OF PROCTRAN-AREA, and DATESEP.

Next, the code uses the STRING verb to split the date into its components (day, month, and year) and store them in the variables WS-ORIG-DATE-DD, WS-ORIG-DATE-MM, and WS-ORIG-DATE-YYYY. The values are then concatenated into the variable WS-STDT-X.

The code then converts the date in WS-STDT-X to a numeric value using the FUNCTION INTEGER-OF-DATE and stores it in the variable WS-INTEGER.

Based on the month value, the code adjusts the WS-INTEGER value by adding 30 or 28 days, taking into account leap years. The adjusted value is then converted back to a date using the FUNCTION DATE-OF-INTEGER and stored in the variable WS-FUTURE-DATE.

Finally, the code extracts the day, month, and year components from WS-FUTURE-DATE and stores them in the variables ACCOUNT-NEXT-STMT-DATE, ACCOUNT-OPENED, and ACCOUNT-LAST-STMT-DATE.

If the read or delete operation fails, the code handles the error by performing error handling and retrying the operation if necessary. If the error is not recoverable, the code generates an abend with a specific code.

After the delete operation, the code updates the process transaction table to indicate that the customer record has been deleted.","This COBOL code is used to read and delete a record from a VSAM file called ""CUSTOMER"". The code first initializes the output data and then attempts to read the record using the desired key. If the read is successful, it updates the output data and deletes the record from the file.

It starts by moving the customer number from the DFHCOMMAREA to the HV-ACCOUNT-CUST-NO and the sort code to the HV-ACCOUNT-SORTCODE. Then, it opens a cursor using the SQL OPEN statement and assigns it to the ACC-CURSOR. The SQLCODE is then moved to the SQLCODE-DISPLAY variable.

If the SQLCODE is not equal to 0, it means there was an error when opening the cursor. In this case, the code performs a CHECK-FOR-STORM-DRAIN-DB2, sets theCOMM-SUCCESS to 'N', CUSTOMER-FOUND to 'N', and COMM-FAIL-CODE to '2'. It then executes a CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK and checks if the response is not equal to the normal response. If it's not, it initializes an ABNDINFO-REC, moves the EIBRESP and EIBRESP2 to ABND-RESPCODE and ABND-RESP2CODE, respectively, and assigns the APPLID using CICS ASSIGN. It then moves the EIBTASKN and EIBTRNID to ABND-TASKNO-KEY and ABND-TRANID, respectively, and populates the time and date. It sets the ABND-CODE to 'HROL', the ABND-SQLCODE to 0, and the ABND-FREEFORM to a specific message. Finally, it executes a CICS LINK PROGRAM with the ABNDINFO-REC and displays an error message.

If the SQLCODE is equal to 0, it means the cursor was successfully opened. The code then performs a FETCH-DATA and closes the cursor using the SQL CLOSE statement. If there is an error when closing the cursor, it sets the COMM-SUCCESS to 'N', CUSTOMER-FOUND to 'N', and COMM-FAIL-CODE to '4'. It then executes a CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK and checks if the response is not equal to the normal response. If it's not, it follows a similar process as when opening the cursor.

If the SQLCODE is still equal to 0 after closing the cursor, it means the cursor was successfully closed. The code then sets the COMM-SUCCESS to 'Y', indicating a successful communication.

The code first checks if the customer number is equal to ZERO or '9999999999'. If it is, it sets the CUSTOMER-FOUND flag to 'N' and the NUMBER-OF-ACCOUNTS to ZERO and then goes to the CC999 label.

If the customer number is not equal to ZERO or '9999999999', it initializes the INQCUST-COMMAREA and moves the customer number from the DFHCOMMAREA to the INQCUST-CUSTNO field.

Then, it uses the CICS LINK instruction to call the INQCUST program and passes the INQCUST-COMMAREA as a parameter.

After the CICS LINK instruction, it checks the value of the INQCUST-INQ-SUCCESS field. If it is equal to 'Y', it sets the CUSTOMER-FOUND flag to 'Y'. Otherwise, it sets the CUSTOMER-FOUND flag to 'N' and the NUMBER-OF-ACCOUNTS to ZERO.

This code can be used to check if a customer number exists and retrieve information about the customer using CICS LINK.### Instruction:
 Explain the CICS LINK instruction in more detail.### Response:
 The CICS LINK instruction is used to call a CICS program from within a COBOL program. It allows the COBOL program to interact with CICS, the transaction processing system used by many businesses, to perform tasks such as updating data, retrieving information, and initiating transactions.

When the CICS LINK instruction is executed, it creates a communication channel between the COBOL program and the CICS program. This channel allows the two programs to exchange data and instructions. The CICS program is then executed within this channel, allowing it to perform its tasks and return any results to the COBOL program.

The CICS LINK instruction can be used to call a CICS program in a variety of ways, depending on the requirements of the COBOL program. It can be used to call a CICS program that performs a single task, such as updating a record in a database, or it can be used to call a CICS program that performs a series of tasks, such as processing a customer order.

In addition to allowing the COBOL program to interact with CICS, the CICS LINK instruction can also be used to pass data between the COBOL program and the CICS program. This data can be in the form of input parameters, output parameters, or data areas that are shared between the two programs.

Overall, the CICS LINK instruction is a powerful tool that allows COBOL programs to interact with CICS and perform a wide range of tasks within the CICS environment.","The COBOL code is used to check if a customer number is in the customer area. If the customer number is not found, it sets the customer found to 'N' and the number of accounts to zero.

It first initializes some variables and then moves data from one area to another. It then executes a SQL statement to insert data into a table called PROCTRAN. If the SQL statement fails, it performs some error handling and then ends the program with an abend.

The code is written in COBOL, which is a programming language used for building business applications. It is often used for tasks such as data processing, system management, and transaction processing. The code uses various COBOL statements such as INITIALIZE, MOVE, EXEC SQL, IF, and END-IF to perform its tasks.

The code also uses some COBOL-specific features such as the ABSTIME and FORMATTIME paragraphs, which are used to work with dates and times. It also uses some DB2-specific features such as the INSERT INTO statement, which is used to insert data into a DB2 table.

Overall, the code is responsible for writing data to a DB2 datastore and handling any errors that may occur during the process.","This COBOL code is used to write data to a DB2 datastore.

It performs a SQL SELECT statement to retrieve data from the POLICY and COMMERCIAL tables. The retrieved data is then stored in various variables for further processing.

The code first initializes the EM-SQLREQ variable with a SELECT statement. Then, it executes the SQL statement using the EXEC SQL verb. The SELECT statement retrieves specific columns from the POLICY and COMMERCIAL tables and stores them in the specified variables.

After executing the SQL statement, the code checks the SQLCODE to determine the success or failure of the query. If the SQLCODE is 0, it means the query was successful.

The code first initializes a SQL request to select data from the ""POLICY"" and ""COMMERCIAL"" tables. It then uses the EXEC SQL statement to execute the SQL request and retrieve the specified fields into the corresponding variables.

After retrieving the data, the code checks the SQLCODE to determine if the operation was successful. If SQLCODE is 0, it means the operation was successful, and the code proceeds to calculate the required length of the output data and checks if it exceeds the available space. If it does, it sets the return code to '98' and returns. Otherwise, it copies the retrieved data to the output variables and sets the filler field to 'FINAL'.

If SQLCODE is not 0, it means there was an error in the SQL operation. The code checks if the SQLCODE is equal to 100, indicating a successful operation with no data found. If it is, the code sets the return code to '01'. Otherwise, it sets the return code to '90' and calls the ""WRITE-ERROR-MESSAGE"" subroutine to handle the error.

Finally, the code exits the subroutine.","This COBOL code is used to retrieve information from a Commercial database. It first moves a string to a variable called EM-SQLREQ.

It first moves the SQL code to a variable called EM-SQLRC. Then it uses the CICS ASKTIME and FORMATTIME functions to get the current time and date, and store them in variables called WS-ABSTIME, WS-DATE, and WS-TIME. It then moves the date and time values to variables called EM-DATE and EM-TIME.

Next, the code uses the CICS LINK function to call a program called 'LGSTSQ' and pass it a COMMAREA called ERROR-MSG. It also passes the length of the ERROR-MSG COMMAREA. The code then checks if the length of the error message is greater than 0. If it is, it checks if the length is less than 91. If it is, it moves the first EIBCALEN characters of the DFHCOMMAREA to a variable called CA-DATA and calls the 'LGSTSQ' program again, passing it the CA-ERROR-MSG COMMAREA and its length. If the length is greater than or equal to 91, it moves the first 90 characters of the DFHCOMMAREA to CA-DATA and calls the 'LGSTSQ' program again.
