ASk Explanation,ASk Purpose
"This COBOL program, part of a CICS (Customer Information Control System) application, assigns the string 'CICS Banking Sample Application' to the variable COMPANY-NAME. It then executes a CICS command RETURN, likely to signal completion or return control to the invoking program. The program ends with GOBACK, which returns control to the caller.","This COBOL code is a simple CICS (Customer Information Control System) transaction. It moves the string 'CICS Banking Sample Application' into the DFHCOMMAREA's COMPANY-NAME field, then issues an EXEC CICS RETURN command to signify completion of the task, and finally performs a GOBACK to end the program execution."
"This COBOL code is a part of a CICS (Customer Information Control System) application. It sets 'CICS Banking Sample Application' into the variable COMPANY-NAME within DFHCOMMAREA. Then, it executes the CICS RETURN command, indicating the completion of a specific task or operation, before finally returning control to the caller with GOBACK.","The provided COBOL code is part of a CICS (Customer Information Control System) application. It moves the string 'CICS Banking Sample Application' into the variable company-name within DFHCOMMAREA and then executes a CICS RETURN command, likely to end or transfer control to another program segment. The GOBACK statement signifies the end of the program."
"This COBOL code segment moves the value of SORTCODE (987654) into ACCOUNT-KEY-RID's REQUIRED-SORT-CODE. It then performs READ-ACCOUNT-DB2, checks if DELACC-DEL-SUCCESS is 'Y'. If true, it executes DEL-ACCOUNT-DB2 and subsequently WRITE-PROCTRAN. Finally, it ends with GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE, unless interrupted by EXIT at A999.","This COBOL code appears to process account data. It moves a specific sort code (987654) into ACCOUNT-KEY-RID's required-sort-code field, then performs reading from an account database (READ-ACCOUNT-DB2). If deletion of the account is successful (DELACC-DEL-SUCCESS = 'Y'), it proceeds to delete the account and subsequently writes process transactions. The loop terminates upon successful deletion or a specific exit condition."
"This COBOL code segment reads account data from a DB2 database using SQL, then populates an output structure (OUTPUT-DATA) with the retrieved fields. If SQL execution fails (SQLCODE != 0 and not +100), it logs abend information and displays error message; if successful (+100), it initializes OUTPUT-DATA and sets success flags.","The provided COBOL code reads account details from a database (using SQL) based on provided ACCOUNT_NUMBER and SORTCODE, populates a host structure with these details, and handles potential SQL errors by logging abend information into ABNDINFO-REC. It then prepares an output data structure for further processing or display."
"This COBOL code performs a DELETE operation on a database table named 'ACCOUNT'. It checks if the account sortcode (:HV-ACCOUNT-SORTCODE) and account number (:HV-ACCOUNT-ACC-NO) match the provided values. If SQLCODE (indicating success or failure of SQL command) is not zero, it sets DELACC-SUCCESS to a blank, DELACC-DEL-SUCCESS to 'N', and DELACC-DEL-FAIL-CD to '3'. The process ends with EXIT in DADB999 section.","This COBOL code is designed to delete a specific account from a database table, 'ACCOUNT', where the sort code and account number match provided inputs (HV-ACCOUNT-SORTCODE and HV-ACCOUNT-ACC-NO). It checks SQLCODE for success or failure, updating relevant flags accordingly."
"This COBOL code snippet defines a section named 'WRITE-PROCTRAN'. It starts with label WP010, which performs the subroutine WRITE-PROCTRAN-DB2. After this subroutine execution, it reaches label WP999 where an EXIT statement is encountered, signifying the end of program flow in this section.","This COBOL code segment is designed to perform a process transaction operation (WRITE-PROCTRAN) and interact with a DB2 database (WRITE-PROCTRAN-DB2). It initiates the process by performing WRITE-PROCTRAN-DB2, then exits the program upon completion."
"This COBOL code (WPD010) initializes data for a DB2 insert operation into PROCTRAN table, setting fields like SORT-CODE, ACC-NUMBER, DATE, TIME, REF, TYPE, DESC, and AMOUNT. It captures CICS environment details in case of an error and logs them before abending. The process ends with WPD999, executing the exit.","The purpose of this COBOL code (WPD010) is to insert a new row into the PROCTRAN table, using data from ACCOUNT-related variables and EIBTASKN. It formats the current time and date, initializes host process transaction row, and handles SQL errors by logging abend information if insertion fails."
"This COBOL code consists of two sections: 'GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE' and its subsections GMOFH010 and GMOFH999. GMOFH010 contains a single command 'GOBACK', which signifies program termination. GMOFH999 has an 'EXIT' statement, another way to end the program execution prematurely. Both sections serve as exit points for different situations within a larger COBOL program.","The provided COBOL code appears to define a program with two sections: GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE. It contains two divisions, GMOFH010 and GMOFH999. The GOBACK statement in GMOFH010 signifies the normal program termination, while EXIT in GMOFH999 likely represents an abnormal or exceptional end of the program."
"This COBOL code segment, named 'POPULATE-TIME-DATE', uses CICS (Customer Information Control System) commands to populate two variables: WS-U-TIME with current absolute time and WS-ORIG-DATE with the current date in DDMMYYYY format. It first calls ASKTIME to get the current time and DATE, then FORMATTIME to structure this data into WS-U-TIME (in Comp-3 format) and WS-ORIG-DATE. The process ends with EXIT command at PTD999.","The provided COBOL code, part of a CICS (Customer Information Control System) program, populates two variables with current date and time. It uses CICS commands ASKTIME to retrieve current absolute time into WS-U-TIME and FORMATTIME to convert this time into a human-readable format (DDMMYYYY and TIME), storing results in WS-ORIG-DATE and WS-TIME-NOW respectively."
"This COBOL code segment moves the value of SORTCODE (987654) into ACCOUNT-KEY-RID's REQUIRED-SORT-CODE. It then performs READ-ACCOUNT-DB2, checks if DELACC-DEL-SUCCESS is 'Y', and if true, executes DEL-ACCOUNT-DB2 and subsequently WRITE-PROCTRAN. Finally, it performs GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE. The process involves database operations (READ, DELETE, WRITE) based on the status indicated by DELACC-DEL-SUCCESS.","The provided COBOL code appears to manage account processing. It moves a SORTCODE into ACCOUNT-KEY-RID, reads the account database, deletes the account if successful (DELACC-DEL-SUCCESS = 'Y'), writes transaction data, and finally exits the process."
